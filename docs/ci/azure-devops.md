# Azure DevOps: Sanctifier scan with downloadable SARIF

Use this integration to make Sanctifier findings visible on Azure Pipelines
builds and PR checks. It produces **both** the original machine-readable JSON
and a SARIF 2.1.0 report without requiring a third-party Python package or
Azure marketplace extension.

## Install in a Soroban repository

1. Copy [azure-pipelines.yml](../../ci/azure/azure-pipelines.yml) to
   `azure-pipelines.yml` at your target repository's root.
2. Copy [sanctifier_to_sarif.py](../../ci/azure/sanctifier_to_sarif.py) to
   `ci/azure/sanctifier_to_sarif.py` in that same target repo. Keep its path
   aligned with the command in the YAML. Both files must be committed.
3. Set `variables.sanctifierScanPath` to the Soroban contract directory (or
   workspace) containing its `Cargo.toml`. The default `.` is appropriate
   only if your repository root is a valid Soroban project.
4. In Azure DevOps, create a **Pipeline** from that repository's
   `azure-pipelines.yml`. Enable pull-request build validation for the target
   branch according to the repository's Azure Repos/GitHub trigger settings.

The full copy-paste job (installation, scanning, conversion and publication)
is in [azure-pipelines.yml](../../ci/azure/azure-pipelines.yml). The key steps:

```yaml
variables:
  sanctifierScanPath: 'contracts/my-token'

steps:
  # ... checkout and pinned Rust/dependency installation from example ...
  - bash: |
      set -euo pipefail
      report_dir="$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/sanctifier"
      mkdir -p "$report_dir"
      set +e
      sanctifier analyze "$(sanctifierScanPath)" --format json > "$report_dir/findings.json"
      scan_status=$?
      set -e
      python3 ci/azure/sanctifier_to_sarif.py \
        "$report_dir/findings.json" "$report_dir/results.sarif"
      exit "$scan_status"
    displayName: Scan and generate SARIF

  - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
    condition: succeededOrFailed()
    inputs:
      targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/sanctifier'
      artifact: sanctifier-analysis
      publishLocation: pipeline
```

The example pins Rust **1.85.0** and installs `libz3-dev`,
`libdbus-1-dev`, and `pkg-config` to match Sanctifier's build prerequisites.
It builds `sanctifier-cli` with `cargo install --locked --git`; CI runners
need network access and permission to install build dependencies. For
reproducible builds, pin the upstream Sanctifier Git commit or vendor a known
CLI binary in your production pipeline.

## Results and failure behavior

- **Scan output:** `sanctifier-analysis/findings.json`, in Sanctifier's
  real `analyze --format json` schema.
- **SARIF:** `sanctifier-analysis/results.sarif`, standard SARIF 2.1.0,
  downloadable from the pipeline run's published artifact.
- **Gate:** high/critical findings retain the CLI's nonzero exit status.
  The artifact publishing step uses `succeededOrFailed()` so a completed
  scan still publishes evidence when findings fail the check.
- **Locations:** only findings with a known repository-relative `.rs` file
  **and** positive line number receive SARIF code locations; do not invent
  locations for summary-only entries.
- **Severity:** critical/high map to SARIF `error`, medium to `warning`,
  low/info to `note`; other findings use `warning`.
- **Azure UI:** the built-in task publishes a downloadable SARIF artifact.
  It does **not** automatically populate Azure DevOps Advanced Security,
  Code Analysis, or PR inline annotations; those require a separately
  configured compatible ingestion extension/service.

The generator intentionally reads `sanctifier analyze --format json` instead
of relying on `sanctifier ci --format sarif`: current `ci` prints a
human-readable banner, and its analyzer only recognizes `json` as the JSON
output path. Redirecting `ci --format sarif` would not produce valid SARIF.

## Focused offline smoke check

Run this in a checkout containing the copied converter. It exercises both a
located finding and one without an exact source location, including the
artifact's required SARIF envelope:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, tempfile, subprocess
from pathlib import Path

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as directory:
    p = Path(directory)
    (p / "input.json").write_text(json.dumps({"findings": {
        "panic_issues": [
            {"code": "S003", "function_name": "mint",
             "location": "src/lib.rs:42"}
        ],
        "auth_gaps": [{"code": "S001", "function": "transfer"}],
    }}))
    subprocess.run(["python3", "ci/azure/sanctifier_to_sarif.py",
                    str(p / "input.json"), str(p / "out.sarif")],
                   check=True)
    sarif = json.loads((p / "out.sarif").read_text())
    assert sarif["version"] == "2.1.0"
    results = sarif["runs"][0]["results"]
    assert len(results) == 2
    located = next(r for r in results if r["ruleId"] == "S003")
    assert located["locations"][0]["physicalLocation"]["region"]["startLine"] == 42
    unlocated = next(r for r in results if r["ruleId"] == "S001")
    assert "locations" not in unlocated
    print("Azure SARIF adapter fixture smoke: PASS")
PY
```

This local check covers JSON-to-SARIF behavior, **not** an execution on hosted
Azure DevOps; a live Azure pipeline run is needed to verify its runner image,
CLI installation, artifact publication and PR trigger wiring.
