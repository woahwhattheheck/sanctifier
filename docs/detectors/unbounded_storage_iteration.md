## What it catches

A public Soroban contract entrypoint that loads a collection from
`storage().persistent()` or `storage().instance()` and then iterates the
whole collection without an obvious length cap or bounded iterator step.
Because durable state can grow independently of a single call, the loop's
worst-case work is O(n) in stored collection length and can eventually exhaust
the transaction budget.

## Vulnerable example

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl Registry {
    pub fn rebuild_index(env: Env) {
        let members: Vec<Address> = env
            .storage()
            .persistent()
            .get(&MEMBERS)
            .unwrap_or(Vec::new(&env));

        for member in members.iter() {
            rebuild_one(&env, member);
        }
    }
}
```

## The fix

Bound the work per invocation. Reject oversized state before the loop, or
process a bounded page and resume in a later invocation:

```rust
assert!(members.len() <= MAX_MEMBERS);
for member in members.iter() {
    rebuild_one(&env, member);
}

// Or process at most MAX_PER_CALL entries this invocation.
for member in members.iter().take(MAX_PER_CALL) {
    rebuild_one(&env, member);
}
```

## How Sanctifier detects it

The rule works within one public `#[contractimpl]` function. It records local
bindings whose initializer contains a `persistent().get(..)`,
`persistent().try_get(..)`, `instance().get(..)`, or
`instance().try_get(..)`, then looks for `for` loops over those bindings.
A visible `.len()` check in an `if`/`while` condition or guard macro, or
a `.take(..)` iterator bound, suppresses the advisory.

**Limitations:** this is intentionally local and conservative. Bounds hidden in
a helper function or enforced by a contract-wide invariant are not inferred.
If the invariant is real, make the bound explicit near the loop or use a
justified suppression.
