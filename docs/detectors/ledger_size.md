## What it catches

A `#[contracttype]` struct or enum whose estimated serialized size approaches or
exceeds the ledger entry size limit (~64 KB by default, configurable with
`--limit`). Oversized entries are expensive to read/write and can make an
entrypoint **impossible to call** once the data grows, effectively bricking the
contract for that key.

## Vulnerable example

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct Registry {
    // An unbounded Vec inside a single ledger entry: grows until writes fail.
    pub entries: Vec<Record>,   // Record is itself large
    pub audit_log: Vec<String>, // append-only, never pruned
}
```

## The fix

Shard large collections across multiple keys so no single entry is unbounded:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    Record(u32),      // one ledger entry per record
    RecordCount,      // small counter entry
}

// Store each record under its own key instead of one giant Vec.
env.storage().persistent().set(&DataKey::Record(id), &record);
```

Keep hot, frequently-read metadata small; move append-only history off-chain or
into per-item keys.

## How Sanctifier detects it

The rule parses each `#[contracttype]` independently and computes an
**XDR-shaped payload estimate**, not a Rust in-memory `size_of` value. Fixed
width values include the `ScVal` type tag and XDR payload: small Rust integer
types widen to the 32-bit Soroban scalar representation, `u64`/`i64` and
128/256-bit values budget their wider XDR payloads, `Address` uses the larger
account-address representation, fixed arrays include container framing, and
`BytesN<N>` includes its padded fixed byte payload.

### Documented estimation margin

For fixed-width fields, Sanctifier applies a **one-sided +10% serialization
safety margin** to the calculated payload before comparing it with the ledger
entry budget. This is the detector's documented error/safety margin for
thresholding; it intentionally biases toward warning before the protocol cap
because a stored value is only part of the complete serialized ledger entry.

Every finding reports a per-type budget:

- raw estimated bytes;
- bytes after the +10% safety margin;
- remaining bytes before the configured limit;
- the configured limit itself.

The default near-cap threshold remains 80% of the configured limit. The safety
margin is applied first, so a type whose budgeted size crosses 80% is reported
as `ApproachingLimit`, while a budgeted size at or above the limit is
`ExceedsLimit`.

**Dynamic-size limitation:** `Bytes`, `String`, `Symbol`, `Vec`, `Map`,
and unresolved user-defined types cannot be given a finite upper bound from the
type alone. For those cases the detector uses a documented representative
payload/one-element growth floor. The +10% margin is **not** a universal upper
error bound for runtime-sized collections. Pair this rule with
[`unbounded_storage`](unbounded_storage.md) when collection growth is the
risk.

The golden `ledger_size` fixture intentionally keeps a `[u8; 4096]` case
that the old 32-byte fallback overestimated at 131 KB. It now produces no
finding; focused unit coverage separately checks both a near-cap warning and an
over-cap error.
